---- Information ----

This Repo will store information about my Project on the IAIK Institute 
at Graz University of Technology.
It contains bookmarks with interesting reading-stuff, 
but also documents with information that is originally not my intellectual property. 

It just summarize the huge amount of information to a small useful guide to set up an environment to emulate a full ARM-based xilinx board called "zynq".
It also contains solutions for rarely documented problems i discovered. 
Furthermore it's planned to deploy own stuff. We will try to archieve memory encryption within an emulated board based on these zedboards. 

My own summary can be found in meta-xilinx  yocto-poky emulate on qemu.pdf

If anybody feels violated in his intellectual property in a way he doesn't feel comfortable about, please let me know.
